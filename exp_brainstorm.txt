Solo (bad solo class) - 1 level/2 hours
Solo (good solo class) - 1 level/1.5 hours
Group - 1 level/1 hour


Solo bad - 1 kill / 10 minutes.
Solo necro - 1 kills / 4 minutes.
Group - 1 kill / 2 minutes.


ONE LEVEL = 90 MINUTES
MINUTES_PER_KILL = if ACTIVE_MINUTES_SINCE_LAST_KILL >= 3 {
    3
} else {
    ACTIVE_MINUTES_SINCE_LAST_KILL + REGEN_MINUTES_SINCE_LAST_KILL * 0.50
}

if last kill is less than 2 minutes ago, exp + 20%


Solo
===

- Must kill within 3 non-regen minutes of previous kill, otherwise reduced xp back to 3 minutes.
- regen minutes stop counting if mana and health reach above 80%
- regen minutes caps at minutes needed to reach 80% health/mana from time of last kill. After that, it counts towards non-regen minute cap.


Group
===

- Add everyones expected MINUTES, multiply by group bonus, divide by number of group members.

Group bonus:
2p = 10%
3p = 15%
4p = 20%
5p = 25%
6p = 30%





Levels 1-10, 30 minutes solo
Levels 11-50, 2 hours solo, 1 group.
Levels 51-59, 3 hours solo, 2 group.
Level 60, 5 hours

After hour-one, exp slows down to 50%. After hour-two, exp slows down to 25%.
BONUS_USED = 0 minutes
- Add to BONUS_USED for every kill
- Every hour, subtract 4 minutes (i.e. 90 minutes/1 level per day)
- if BONUS_USED > 90: Modify final exp value by 50%
- if BONUS_USED > 180: Modify final exp value by 75%  (sliding scale, 90-180 => 50-75%)

- Record time and bonus used when saving character. Subtract appropriate amount based on time passed when loading character.
